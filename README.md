# Password-Generator
In this homework I created a password generator that gives the user prompts so that it can get the certain criteria that the user wants for their password. The prompts ask for the length of the password, the use of upper case, lower case, and the use of special characters. 
If the user does not select a length between 8 and 128 characters, then a prompt will appear that will let the user know that the there is too little or too many characters for the password.
If the user selects no to all of the criteria of the password then a prompt will appear that will let the user know that they must select criteria for the password and will bring the user back 
to the start of the function.
